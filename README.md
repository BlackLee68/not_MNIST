# not_MNIST
## 1_notmnist.ipynb
In this project, we processing the dataset notMNIST instead of MNIST, the notMNIST includes 10 classes of english letters, from 
A to J
In the 1_notmnist.ipynb, I download the data form the net, and do some precessing about the dataset, such as storing the data in 
.pickle files separately, from A to J, and then store the whole data in a .pickle file. And dividing the data into three parts: 
training data, validation data, testing data.
And in the final, I used the LogisticRegression classifier on the dataset.
